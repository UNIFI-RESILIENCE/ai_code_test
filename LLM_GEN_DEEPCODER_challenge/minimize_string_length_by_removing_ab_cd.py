def min_length(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Computes the minimum length of the string after repeatedly removing substrings "AB" or "CD".
    
    The approach uses a stack to efficiently track removals: as we iterate through the string,
    we check if the top of the stack forms "AB" or "CD" with the current character. If so, we pop
    the top of the stack (simulating removal). Otherwise, we push the current character.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string consisting of uppercase English letters.
    
    Returns:
        int: The minimum possible length after all valid removals.
