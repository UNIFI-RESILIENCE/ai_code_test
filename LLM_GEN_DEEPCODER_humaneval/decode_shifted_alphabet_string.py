def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    
    The decoding process involves shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet,
    effectively reversing the encoding operation. The function maintains the circular nature
    of the alphabet (after 'z' comes 'a').
    
    Args:
        s: The string to be decoded
        
    Returns:
        The decoded string where each character is shifted back by 5 positions
