def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """Find the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

    The algorithm works by identifying the longest palindromic suffix of the input string.
    Then, it appends the reverse of the remaining prefix (the part before the palindromic suffix)
    to the end of the original string to form the shortest palindrome.

    Args:
        string: The input string for which to construct the shortest palindrome.

    Returns:
        The shortest palindrome that starts with the input string.

    Examples:
        >>> make_palindrome('')
        ''
        >>> make_palindrome('cat')
        'catac'
        >>> make_palindrome('cata')
        'catac'
