Here's the optimum implementation of the below_zero function based on the given problem description:

from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False

This implementation correctly updates the balance with each operation and checks whether it drops below zero at any point. If it does, the function returns True immediately; otherwise, it returns False after examining all operations.
