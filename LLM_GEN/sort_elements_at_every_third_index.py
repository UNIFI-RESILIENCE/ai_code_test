Here is the optimum implementation of the sort_third function:

def sort_third(l: list):
    # Find the indices divisible by 3
    indices_div_3 = [i for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    # Extract the values at those indices
    values_to_sort = sorted(l[i] for i in indices_div_3)
    
    # Copy original list to maintain structure
    result = l[:]
    
    # Insert the sorted values back into their original positions
    for idx, sorted_val in zip(indices_div_3, values_to_sort):
        result[idx] = sorted_val
    
    return result

This function satisfies the problem requirements:
- It identifies indices divisible by 3.
- Sorts only those elements.
- Preserves other elements at their respective positions.
