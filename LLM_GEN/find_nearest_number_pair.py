Here's the optimum implementation of the function based on the given description and test cases:

from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    """
    # Sort numbers to bring closest elements next to each other
    numbers.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Iterate through adjacent pairs to find the smallest difference
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair

This approach is optimal in both performance and clarity:

- The list is first sorted in O(n log n) time.
- Then it iterates once through the sorted list (O(n) time) to find the closest pair by comparing each pair of adjacent elements.

This ensures correctness while maintaining good performance.
