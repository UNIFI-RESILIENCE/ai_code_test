To determine the number of collisions, consider the fact that each car moving left to right (n cars) will collide with every car moving right to left (also n cars), since they all move at the same speed and continue on their paths infinitely.

Therefore, the total number of collisions is:

n (left-to-right cars) × n (right-to-left cars) = n²

Here is the optimal implementation:

def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    return n * n

This function simply returns the square of n, which correctly represents the total number of collisions between two groups of n cars moving in opposite directions.
