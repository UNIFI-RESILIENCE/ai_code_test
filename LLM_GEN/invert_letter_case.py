Here's the optimized implementation for the flip_case function:

def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase."""
    return string.swapcase()

This implementation uses Python's built-in str.swapcase() method, which is specifically designed to convert all lowercase characters to uppercase and all uppercase characters to lowercase in a string. It is efficient and concise.
