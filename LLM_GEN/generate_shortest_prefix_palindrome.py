Here is the optimum implementation for the provided make_palindrome function:

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm:
    - Find the longest suffix of the string which is a palindrome.
    - Then, take the prefix that remains, reverse it, and append it to the end.
    """
    for i in range(len(string)):
        suffix = string[i:]
        if suffix == suffix[::-1]:
            prefix_to_add = string[:i][::-1]
            return string + prefix_to_add
    return ''

# The function works by gradually checking from the beginning of the string 
# and slicing to see if a suffix is a palindrome. When it finds one, it reverses 
# the prefix before it and appends to the end of the original string, 
# generating the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string.
