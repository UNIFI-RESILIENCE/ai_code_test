Here's the optimum implementation for the has_close_elements function based on the problem description and the given assertions:

from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if abs(numbers[i+1] - numbers[i]) < threshold:
            return True
    return False

Explanation:

- We first sort the list. This allows us to compare only adjacent elements for closeness, which is more efficient than comparing all pairs.
- Then, we iterate through the sorted list and compare each adjacent pair.
- If the difference between any two adjacent numbers is less than the threshold, we return True.
- If no such pair is found, we return False.

Time complexity:

- Sorting the list takes O(n log n), and the loop runs in O(n), so overall it's O(n log n), which is optimal for this problem.
