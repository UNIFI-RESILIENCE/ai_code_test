Here's the optimum code to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height:

def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and height, return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h

This implementation uses the standard formula for the area of a triangle: (1/2) × base × height.
