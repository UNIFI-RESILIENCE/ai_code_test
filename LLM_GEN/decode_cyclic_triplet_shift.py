To decode the string encoded using the encode_cyclic function, we need to reverse the transformation applied to each group of 3 characters during encoding. The encoding logic moves the first character to the end (i.e., group[1:] + group[0]), so decoding should rotate the group in the opposite direction â€” bringing the last character to the front (i.e., group[-1] + group[:-1]).

Here's the implementation of decode_cyclic:

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    Takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # Split string to groups of length 3
    groups = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]
    # Reverse the cyclic shift: move last character to front if group has 3 chars
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return ''.join(groups)

This function correctly decodes any string encoded by encode_cyclic.
